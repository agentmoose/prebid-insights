# prebid-integration-monitor

This project is designed to monitor Prebid integrations. It is now built using TypeScript and uses Vitest for testing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prebid/prebid-integration-monitor.git
    cd prebid-integration-monitor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the TypeScript source code for the application.
    -   `index.ts`: The main entry point of the application.
    -   `cluster.cts`: Handles Puppeteer cluster setup (uses CommonTS syntax).
    -   `utils/`: Utility scripts.
    -   Other `.ts` files for application logic.
-   `dist/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript code, generated by `npm run build`. This directory is usually not committed to version control.
-   `tests/`: Contains test files written using Vitest.
    -   `example.test.ts`: An example test file.
-   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and npm scripts.
-   `tsconfig.json`: Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.
-   `node_modules/`: Directory where npm installs project dependencies.

## Development

To run the application in development mode (using `ts-node` to execute TypeScript directly without a separate build step):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Note on `ts-node` execution:** In some environments, if `ts-node` is not found, you might need to run it via `npx`:
```bash
npx -p ts-node ts-node src/index.ts
```

## Building for Production

To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript (output will be in the `dist/` directory):

```bash
npm run build
```

**Note on `tsc` execution:** In some environments, if `tsc` (the TypeScript compiler) is not found via the npm script, you might need to invoke it using `npx`:
```bash
npx -p typescript tsc
```
This command typically isn't needed if `npm run build` works, as `npm run build` should use the `tsc` from your project's `devDependencies`. The type checking can also be done using `npm run build:check` or `npx -p typescript tsc --noEmit --module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext src/**/*.ts src/cluster.cts`.

## Running in Production

After building the project (`npm run build`), run the compiled application:

```bash
npm start
```
This executes `node dist/index.js`.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite using Vitest:

```bash
npm test
```

**Note on `vitest` execution:** In some environments, if `vitest` is not found via the npm script, you might need to run it using `npx`:
```bash
npx -p vitest vitest run
```

This will execute all tests found in the `tests/` directory.
