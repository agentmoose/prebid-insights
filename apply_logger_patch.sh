# Define start and end markers for the block to be replaced
# The block starts with `winston.format.printf(info => {`
# and ends with the `})` that closes the printf, immediately before `      )` of the combine.
# This is tricky with sed. Let's try to find a unique anchor for the start and count lines or use awk.

# Using awk for more robust multiline replacement
awk -v new_block="$NEW_PRINTF_BLOCK" '
  BEGIN { printing = 1; replaced = 0; }
  /winston\.format\.printf\(info => \{/ {
    if (!replaced) {
      print new_block;
      printing = 0;
      replaced = 1;
    }
  }
  # This regex needs to be specific to the end of the printf block.
  # Assuming the block ends like `return message;` followed by `})` on its own line or similar.
  # Let'\''s target the specific closing `})` of the printf.
  # This will be tricky if the structure isn'\''t exactly as assumed.
  # A safer bet is to find the line containing `})` that is followed by `format.colorize(),` or `format.json()`
  # or simply the end of the `combine()` call.
  # For now, let'\''s assume the printf block is well-defined and the closing `})` is distinct enough
  # or that the original script intended a simpler marker.
  # The script uses /^\s*\)\s*$/ which looks for a line with only a closing parenthesis.
  # This might be too generic. Let'\''s try to be more specific if possible,
  # but stick to the provided script'\''s logic for now.
  # The provided awk script has a regex for the end: /^\s*\)\s*$/
  # This is intended to match the closing parenthesis of the printf block.
  # Let'\''s refine this to target the specific `})` that concludes the `printf`
  # and is typically followed by `,` if other formatters are present, or `)` if it'\''s the last.
  # The script has: /^\s*\)\s*$/
  # This looks for a line that essentially only contains a closing parenthesis, possibly with whitespace.
  # Given the structure of winston formatters, the printf is often followed by a comma and other formatters,
  # or a closing parenthesis of the `combine` method.
  # The provided awk script has:
  # /^\s*\)\s*$/ { # Matches the closing parenthesis of printf call before the next transport formatter
  # if (!printing) {
  # printing = 1;
  # next; # Skip printing this line as it is part of the replaced block
  # }
  # }
  # This logic seems to be: when `winston.format.printf(info => {` is found, print new block, stop printing original.
  # Then, when a line with just `)` is found (assumed end of block), start printing original lines again.
  # This might be problematic if there are other single `)` lines.
  # Let'\''s adjust the end marker logic slightly to be more robust by looking for the specific closing of the printf.
  # The printf ends with `return message;` then `})`.
  # So, the line after `return message;` which is `})` is the real end of the lambda.
  # The awk script finds the start, prints the new block, then stops printing.
  # It needs a clear signal to resume printing *after* the old block.
  # The original script uses `/^\s*\)\s*$/` to resume printing. This refers to the closing `)` of `combine(`,
  # which is too late. It should resume after the `})` of the `printf`.

  # Corrected AWK logic:
  # 1. Find the start of the printf block.
  # 2. Print the new block.
  # 3. Set a flag `in_old_block = 1`.
  # 4. While `in_old_block`, skip lines until the end of the old printf block is found.
  # 5. The old printf block ends with a line containing just `})` (closing the function and printf).
  # 6. Once that line is passed, reset `in_old_block = 0` and resume printing.

  /winston\.format\.printf\(info => \{/ {
    if (!replaced) {
      print new_block;
      in_old_block = 1; # Start skipping old block content
      replaced = 1;
      next; # Move to next line after printing new block
    }
  }

  # This regex should match the specific `})` that closes the printf.
  # It might be on a line by itself or like `        })`

  }

  { if (!in_old_block && printing) print; } # Print if not in old block and printing is generally on
